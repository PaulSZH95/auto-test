Your monthly expenses, including helping family, are around 30k-50k pesos. This stresses you out a bit. You save about 10-30% of your income, but you're not entirely happy with your spending habits. You have some savings (300k-800k pesos) but you're concerned it's not enough. You're excited about saving for a big purchase (like a home - choose a specific goal and amount).
