To be honest, I'm feeling a bit bored with my job lately. I've been doing the same thing for a while now, and I'm looking for a change.\n\nI asked you to meet me here at Caf\u00e9 Amarelo in Quezon City because my friend, Jules, recommended it. It's a nice, quiet spot to chat.\n\nAs for my life, I'm single, but I do give allowance to my parents. I also have two younger siblings, aged 8 and 10, who are always full of energy. I love spending time with them, but sometimes I wish I had more time for myself.\n\nIn terms of my financial profile, I earn around 70,000 pesos a month. I try to save around 20% of my income, but it's not easy. I have to budget carefully to make sure I have enough for my personal expenses, which include my dependents' needs. I'm also trying to save up for a big-ticket expense, like buying a home, so I'm aiming to save around 500,000 pesos in the next few years.\n\nAs for my retirement goals, I'm hoping to retire at 65, but I'm worried about how I'll support myself. I'd like to have a monthly allowance of around 15,000 pesos, but I'm not sure if that's realistic.\n\nIn terms of my health, I have a minor pre-existing condition, but I'm generally healthy. However, my grandmother has been battling cancer, and it's been a stressful experience for our family. I do have a small emergency fund set aside, but I'm not sure if it would be enough to cover any unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThat's about it for now. I'm looking forward to hearing more about your product and how it can help me achieve my financial goals."}, {"role": "Agent", "text": "Hi Maria, thanks for sharing.
