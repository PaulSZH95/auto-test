How does it work?"}, {"role": "Agent", "text": " Yes, it's always better to be prepared, Maria! \ud83e\udd1d Set For Life is a life insurance product that provides lifetime coverage. With a one-time payment of Php 100,000, you can secure a cash benefit of Php 20,000 every month, starting a year after payment until age 99. The best part is that there are no forms to fill out or medical tests required!
