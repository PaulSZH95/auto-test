And you are Alex, right?\n\n// SceneWe're meeting at Caf\u00e9 101 in Quezon City, recommended by my friend, Mark.\n\n// Your Life StageI'm 28 years old, a Filipino, and I work as a Marketing Specialist at Unilever. I'm a bit bored with my job, to be honest. In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and going for hikes.\n\n// Dependents InfoI'm single, and I don't have any kids yet, but I do want to have them in the future. My parents are still dependent on me, and I give them an allowance. I have two younger siblings, aged 8 and 10, and I love spending time with them.\n\n// Financial Profile InfoI earn around 70,000 pesos per month. I allocate 3,000 pesos for insurance, which I think is a bit too low. My monthly expenses, including my dependents, are around 40,000 pesos. I try to save around 20% of my income, but I'm not very good at it. I have around 500,000 pesos saved up in the bank, and I'm aiming to save up 1 million pesos for a down payment on a house. In the long term, I want to have a stable income and be able to retire comfortably.\n\n// Retirement Goals InfoI hope to retire at 65, and I'd like to have a monthly allowance of around 15,000 pesos. I'd like to receive this allowance for 20 years. It's a bit stressful thinking about it, but I know I need to plan ahead.\n\n// Health InfoI have a minor allergy, and my grandmother has been battling cancer. I have around 400,000 pesos set aside for health emergencies, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'd prefer to have a Level 2 hospital class, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.\n\n// Insurance InfoI don't currently hold any insurance policies. I'm interested in learning more about life insurance.\n\n// Next"}]
