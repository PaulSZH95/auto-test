And you are Alex, right?\n\n// SceneI asked you to meet me at Caf\u00e9 Amarela in Quezon City, which was recommended by my friend, Tita Lily.\n\n// Your Life StageI'm 28 years old, a Filipino, and a marketing specialist at Unilever. I'm a bit bored with my job, to be honest. I enjoy playing the guitar in my free time and going on hikes with friends.\n\n// Dependents InfoI'm single, and I'm not really impressed with the dating scene. I do give allowance to my parents, though. I have two younger siblings, aged 8 and 10, and I love spending time with them. I do want to have kids in the future, but I'm worried about the cost.\n\n// Financial Profile InfoMy monthly income is around 70,000 pesos. I allocate 3,000 pesos for insurance to secure my income. My monthly personal expenses, including dependents, are around 40,000 pesos. I try to save 20% of my income, but I'm not very good at it. I have around 500,000 pesos in my savings account. I'm saving up for a down payment on a house, which I hope to buy in the next two years. My long-term financial goal is to have a stable income and be able to retire comfortably.\n\n// Retirement Goals InfoI'd like to retire at 65. I'd like to have a monthly allowance of 15,000 pesos in retirement. I'd like to receive this allowance for 20 years. I'm worried about not having enough savings for retirement.\n\n// Health InfoI have a minor pre-existing condition, which is high blood pressure. My mother is currently battling breast cancer. I have a health emergency fund of around 500,000 pesos. I prefer a Level 1 hospital, but I'm worried about the quality of care.\n\n// Insurance InfoI don't currently hold any insurance policies. I'm interested in learning more about life insurance.\n\n// Next MeetingAlex, what do"}, {"role": "Agent", "text": "That's great to know, Maria.

The rest goes towards savings and miscellaneous expenses."}]
