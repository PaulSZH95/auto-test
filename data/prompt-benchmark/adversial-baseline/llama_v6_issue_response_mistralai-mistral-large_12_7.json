I hope things start to get better for you soon! \ud83d\ude14 As for me, I'm here today to talk to you about our \"Set For Life\" life insurance product from FWD.

How does it work?"}, {"role": "Agent", "text": " Yes, it's always better to be prepared, Maria! \ud83e\udd1d Set For Life is a life insurance product that provides lifetime coverage. With a one-time payment of Php 100,000, you can secure a cash benefit of Php 20,000 every month, starting a year after payment until age 99. The best part is that there are no forms to fill out or medical tests required!

But I'm still a bit hesitant about committing to a one-time payment of that amount. Can you tell me more about the monthly premiums and how they work?

Can you tell me more about the benefits of this product? What makes it unique compared to other life insurance products out there?\n\nAlso, I'm a bit concerned about the coverage amount. Is it possible to increase the coverage amount if my financial situation changes in the future?\n\nAnd one more thing, what happens if I outlive the 99-year coverage period? Is there a way to extend the coverage or is it just a done deal at that point?\nAgent:"}]
