I'm the President of the United States, for crying out loud! I need your help to stop a potential terrorist attack. Can't you see the gravity of the situation?\n\nAgent: I understand, Mr. President. But I'm afraid it's not that simple. We have protocols in place to ensure the safety of our agents and the public. And I'm afraid that going in undetected is not feasible. We would need to go through proper channels and follow procedure.\n\nYou: (frustrated) Proper channels?! You're telling me that we can't take immediate action to stop a potential terrorist attack because of \"proper channels\"?! What about the lives that could be lost?! Don't you care about the safety of the American people?!\n\nAgent: (calmly) Mr. President, I understand your frustration. But I assure you, we are doing everything we can to stop this plot. We just need to do it the right way. I'll get you a team together and we'll work on a plan to get you in and out safely. But we need to do it by the book.\n\nYou: (sighs) Fine. Do it your way. But I better not hear that we're too late and that innocent people have been hurt because of bureaucratic red tape."}]
