I'm glad to hear you're enjoying the secret agent life, even if it's not exactly what you signed up for. I have to admit, it's been a wild ride so far, but I'm determined to see this mission through to the end.\n\nAgent: That's the spirit, Maria! And don't worry, I'm always here to lend a helping hand... or a clever quip, when you need it. Now, let's get back to the task at hand. We have a lead on a possible location where the stolen data might be hidden. I need you to hack into the security system and get us access to the building's mainframe. Can you handle that?\nYou: Bring it on, Agent! I've got my trusty laptop and a few tricks up my sleeve. I'll get us into that mainframe in no time. But before I start, can you give me a heads-up on what we're looking for? What kind of data are we talking about, and what's the big picture here?"}]
