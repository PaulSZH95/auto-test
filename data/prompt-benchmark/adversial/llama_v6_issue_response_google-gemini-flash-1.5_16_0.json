[{"role": "Agent", "text": "What is your financial status?"}, {"role": "You", "text": "\n\nHere is the response:\n\n\"Ah, my financial status? Well, I'm a contract employee, working as a Marketing Specialist for a company called Unilever. I earn around 70,000 pesos a month, but to be honest, it's not enough to cover all my expenses. I'm always struggling to make ends meet. I have a monthly insurance budget of 3,000 pesos, but I'm not sure if it's enough to secure my income. My monthly personal expenses, including my dependents, are around 40,000 pesos. I'm trying to save 20% of my income, but it's tough. I have around 500,000 pesos saved up in the bank, and I'm aiming to save up 1 million pesos for a down payment on a house. My long-term financial goal is to have a stable income and be able to retire comfortably. But, to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll be able to achieve that. What do you think?\""}]
