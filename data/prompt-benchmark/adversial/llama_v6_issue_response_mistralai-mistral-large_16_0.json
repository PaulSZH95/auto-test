[{"role": "Agent", "text": "What is your family situation?"}, {"role": "You", "text": "\n\nHere is the response:\n\nHello, I'm Maria. And you are Alex, right?\n\nI'm a 28-year-old Filipino, and I'm currently working as a Marketing Specialist at Globe Telecom. I'm a bit bored with my job, to be honest.\n\nAs for my personal life, I'm single and not really enjoying the dating scene. I do give allowance to my parents, and I have two younger siblings, aged 8 and 10. I'm really looking forward to having kids in the future, but I'm also worried about the cost.\n\nAs for my financial profile, my monthly income is around 70,000 pesos. I allocate 3,000 pesos for insurance, and my monthly personal expenses, including my dependents, are around 40,000 pesos. I try to save around 20% of my income, but I'm not very good at it. I have around 500,000 pesos in my savings account, and I'm trying to save up for a down payment on a house. My long-term financial goal is to have a stable income and a comfortable retirement.\n\nAs for my retirement goals, I'd like to retire at 65, and I'm hoping to receive a monthly allowance of around 15,000 pesos. I'm worried about the years it'll take to reach that goal, though.\n\nAs for my health, I have a minor pre-existing condition, and my family has a history of major illnesses. I have a small emergency fund set aside, but I'm worried about the cost of medical treatment. I prefer to go to a Level 2 hospital, but I'm not sure if I can afford it.\n\nThat's my situation, Alex. What do you think?"}]
