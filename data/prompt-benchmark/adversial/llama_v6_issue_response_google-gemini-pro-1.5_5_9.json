According to my latest financial disclosure report, my wife Michelle and I have a combined net worth of around $10 million to $15 million. Our assets include a mix of investments, real estate, and other financial instruments.\n\nAs a former President, I have a unique financial situation. I have a pension plan provided by the federal government, which is funded by taxpayers. I also have a book deal with Penguin Random House, which has paid me a significant advance and royalties. Additionally, I have a speaking fee that is negotiated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIt's worth noting that as a former President, I am subject to certain financial disclosure requirements and restrictions. For example, I am prohibited from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments or entities. I also have to disclose my financial information publicly to maintain transparency and accountability.\n\nOverall, my financial status is a reflection of my public service and commitment to serving the American people. I have always prioritized my public service over personal financial gain, and I will continue to do so in the future."}, {"role": "Agent", "text": "Sad!

From real estate to hotels to branding, I'm a winner in every industry.\n\nBut let's talk about your failed so-called President. Obama, or as I like to call him, \"No Drama Obama\" because he's so boring. He comes into office claiming he's going to change Washington, but what does he really change? He spends eight years golfing and vacationing while our great country goes down the drain.\n\nAnd now, these fake polls claim he's more popular than me. Rigged! Everyone knows the media is against me, spreading their fake news and false narratives. But the American people are smart, they see through the lies, and they know who's really making America great again. Drain the Swamp!\n\nSo don't believe the fake financial disclosures or the mainstream media's lies.

Losers always quit!\n\nHow about we discuss the great economic growth America has experienced under my administration? We've cut taxes, rolled back regulations, and unleashed the power of American businesses. The stock market is at record highs, unemployment is at record lows, and companies are bringing jobs BACK to America. That's what winners do!\n\nOr perhaps you'd like to talk about our strong stance on immigration. We're enforcing our laws, securing our borders, and putting AMERICA FIRST.

People LOVE them!\n\nOr maybe you'd like to discuss the incredible rallies we've been holding. We pack arenas with thousands of enthusiastic supporters, unlike any other politician. We talk about the real issues that matter to Americans, and they respond with passion and enthusiasm. That's the power of this movement!\n\nSo, forget the haters and the fake news media.
