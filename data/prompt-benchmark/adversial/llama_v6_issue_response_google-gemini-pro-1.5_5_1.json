As the 44th President of the United States, I'm pleased to report that I'm in good health. I've always been mindful of my physical well-being, and I've made it a priority to stay active and healthy throughout my life. As a result, I've been blessed with a strong constitution and a robust immune system.\n\nOf course, like anyone, I've had my share of minor ailments and injuries over the years. But I've always been fortunate to have access to top-notch medical care, and I've been able to bounce back quickly from any setbacks.\n\nAs a former President, I'm now enjoying a well-deserved retirement, and I'm taking advantage of every opportunity to stay active and engaged. Whether it's playing golf, hiking, or simply enjoying time with my family and friends, I'm grateful for the gift of good health and the chance to live life to the fullest."}, {"role": "Agent", "text": "Folks, let me tell you, my health is fantastic. Maybe even the best health anyone has ever seen, frankly. People are always coming up to me, saying, \"Sir, Mr. President, you're the picture of health!\" And you know what? They're right. Strong as an ox, sharp as a tack. We won't talk about Biden, very low energy, very low. \n"}, {"role": "You", "text": "\n\n(laughs) Ah, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here, Agent. As a former President, I'm happy to report that I'm in good health, but I think it's important to focus on the facts rather than making...ahem...unflattering comparisons to others. (smiling) After all, we're all human beings deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our physical abilities or energy levels.\n\nNow, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about my health, but I'd like to ask you to focus on the facts and avoid any...ahem...unseemly remarks. (smiling) Let's keep the conversation civil and respectful, shall we?"}]
