I've never been here before.\n\nAgent: Ah, yes! The cafe is called \"The Daily Grind\" and it's a popular spot in Quezon City. Your friend, Mark, recommended it to me.\n\nYou: Ah, nice! Mark's a good friend. So, what's the plan's premium like? Is it affordable?\n\n(Note: Please respond as Alex, the FWD agent, and provide more information about the plan and its features.)"}]
