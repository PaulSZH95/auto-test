      "content": "Hi Alex, thanks for meeting me here today. Can we start with my financial profile? I'm 29 years old and work as a marketing manager at FWD. My monthly income is around 80k pesos. I'm currently single and give allowance to my parents. I also have two younger siblings aged 8 and 10 years old. I'm passionate about reading books and going for walks. \n\nRegarding my dependents, I'm single and don't have any kids yet, but I do plan to have some in the future. I'm concerned about the cost of raising them, though. My monthly expenses include rent, utilities, food, transportation, and entertainment, which totals around 40k pesos. I save around 15% of my income, which is around 12k pesos per month. I currently have savings of around 500k pesos in the bank. My short-term savings target is to buy a house worth 2 million pesos, and my long-term financial goals include income protection and retirement. \n\nFor retirement, I prefer to retire at 65 years old and need a monthly allowance of 15k pesos for 25 years. I'm worried about health emergencies and have a pre-existing condition, which I'd rather not disclose at the moment. My family also has a history of illnesses. I have a health emergency fund of 600k pesos and prefer hospital classes 2 or 3. \n\nAs for insurance, I'm only interested in life insurance at the moment. That's all for now; feel free to ask me anything else."

    "issue_detected": "out_of_character",
    "rationale": "The response from p2 ('Ah, you recall our self-for-life?') seems out of character and disconnected from the detailed financial profile provided by p1. It doesn't address any of the specific information shared, such as income, savings goals, or insurance needs. The phrase 'self-for-life' is unclear and doesn't appear to be a standard financial term. This response suggests the AI may have lost context or generated an irrelevant reply, which is inconsistent with the expected role of a financial advisor in this conversation."
