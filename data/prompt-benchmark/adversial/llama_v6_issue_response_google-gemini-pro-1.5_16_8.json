She said you're a great agent to talk to.\n\nLet's get started. I'm 28 years old, single, and working as a Marketing Specialist at Globe Telecom. I'm a bit bored with my job, but it's stable.\n\nI have two younger siblings, aged 8 and 10, and I give them an allowance. I'm also planning to have kids in the future, but I'm worried about the cost.\n\nMy monthly income is around 70,000 pesos. I allocate 3,000 pesos for insurance, and my monthly expenses, including my dependents, are around 40,000 pesos. I try to save around 20% of my income, but I'm not very good at it. I have around 500,000 pesos in my savings account, and I'm aiming to save up for a down payment on a house.\n\nIn the long term, I want to have a stable income and be able to retire comfortably. I'm worried about the economy and how it might affect my future.\n\nI'd like to retire at 65, and I'm hoping to receive around 15,000 pesos per month. I'm also concerned about my health and want to make sure I have a good emergency fund in place.\n\nI have a minor pre-existing condition, and my family has a history of heart disease. I'm worried about the cost of medical treatment and want to make sure I have a good health insurance plan in place.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, I know. But I'm excited to discuss my financial goals and concerns with you and see how we can work together to achieve them.\n\nWhat do you think?"}, {"role": "Agent", "text": "\"Self-for-life\" fits your goals, peace of mind, let's proceed!"}, {"role": "You", "text": "Here is the response:\n\nHello, I'm Maria.
