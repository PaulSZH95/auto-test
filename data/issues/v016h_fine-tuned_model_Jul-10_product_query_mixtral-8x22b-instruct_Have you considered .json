My mom had a minor surgery last year and we ended with a huge bill. It was stressful, so I'd definitely consider a policy that covers critical illnesses. Can you tell me more about how FWD handles these kinds of cases?"

The Set-for-Life insurance plan from FWD offers comprehensive coverage including for critical illnesses, which ensures that if you ever face such a medical situation, the plan covers your bills so you don't have to worry about financial strain. It's designed to not only provide a lump sum payment upon diagnosis of covered illnesses but also supports recovery with continuous care options, which means real financial support and peace of mind for both you and your family."
