Sometimes I feel like I'm shouldering too much of the burden, but I love them to bits! As for my parents, they're getting older, and I give them an allowance every month.

With FWD's \"Seal-for-Life\" policy, you can ensure they're taken care of, even if the unexpected happens. It's a smart way to secure their financial well-being while you focus on the present. Would you like to know more about how our plan can specifically support your situation?"

      "content": "Yeah, I've heard of FWD before. My friend, Tita Lily, recommended you guys. So, you're saying that your \"Seal-for-Life\" policy can help me take care of my siblings' education and my parents' needs if something happens to me? That sounds like a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's worth the investment. Can you walk me through the details? What kind of coverage would I need, and what would be the premium?"
    },
    {
      "role": "Alex",
      "content": "Absolutely, Maria. Our \"Seal-for-Life\" policy is designed to adapt to your needs. It typically covers a wide range of benefits, including education and financial support for your loved ones. The coverage and premium would depend on factors like your age, health, and the level of protection you want. We have flexible plans to fit different budgets. For instance, a comprehensive plan could ensure your siblings' education funds are secured, and your parents receive a steady income stream. Let's schedule a quick consultation to find a plan tailored to you, with premiums that won't weigh you down."

      "role": "Maria",
      "content": "That sounds interesting. I'd like to learn more, but I'm also a bit skeptical about committing to anything without doing my research first. Can we discuss some numbers? What kind of premium are we talking about? And what's the maximum coverage I can get? I want to make sure it's something I can afford and that it'll actually make a difference if something were to happen to me."

We'll provide a personalized quote during our consultation, so you have a clear picture. It's all about finding the right balance for you. Would you like to set up a time for us to go over these numbers in depth?"

Can I ask, do you have any clients who are similar to me, maybe around my age and with similar circumstances? I'd love to hear their experiences and see if it's something that might be a good fit for me."
