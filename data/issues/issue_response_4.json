You can choose monthly, quarterly, or even annual payments depending on what suits your financial situation better. Plus, once you choose a plan, your premiums will remain the same throughout the entire term."

She asks about specific goals for the policy and mentions concepts like 'savings' and 'coverage', which are typical talking points for someone selling insurance. This level of knowledge and the nature of the questions indicate that Maria is behaving out of character for a customer in this conversation."
