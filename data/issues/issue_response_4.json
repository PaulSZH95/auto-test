Insurance plans, especially from FWD, are designed to alleviate some of the stress from uncertainties, like accidents or health issues. They act as a financial safety net, so you won't have to worry about unexpected costs derailing your plans. Based on your lifestyle, such as dealing with daily traffic and your weekend hikes, we can look at plans that offer both health coverage and accident protection. Would you like to explore some specific features that might cater to your needs?<|eot_id|>"
