    "rationale": "Maria's statement 'I am not an insurance agent' seems out of character for a typical customer interaction. This type of declarative statement about one's professional status is more likely to come from an AI assistant or a system message clarifying a role, rather than from a customer initiating or continuing a conversation. A customer would typically start with a question or a description of their needs rather than a statement about what they are not."
