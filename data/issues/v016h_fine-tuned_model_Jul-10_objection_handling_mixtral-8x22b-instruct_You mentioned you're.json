      "content": "I'm worried about my income being stable, especially since I work on a contract basis. As an HR Assistant at Accenture, I never know when my contract will be renewed or if there'll be changes in my role. It keeps me up at night thinking about how I'd take care of my family if something happens to me. My mom and dad rely on me for financial support, and I also help my younger siblings with their education. The thought of not being able to provide for them is really stressing me out."

The Set-for-Life insurance plan is designed exactly for situations like yours; it offers financial security for your family by providing a steady income stream in case you are unable to work. This way, you can have peace of mind knowing your family\u2019s needs will be taken care of, no matter what happens with your job situation."

      "role": "Maria",
      "content": "That sounds reassuring, thank you for explaining that. But I still have some doubts about whether I should invest in insurance right now. Can you tell me more about the costs involved? How much would I need to set aside each month for this plan?"

    {
      "role": "Alex",
      "content": "Of course, Maria. The monthly premium for the Set-for-Life insurance plan depends on several factors, including your age and the desired coverage amount. Typically, premiums can start as low as a few dollars a day, making it an affordable way to secure financial protection for your family. We can go through a more detailed quote together to figure out the exact cost based on your specific needs."

      "role": "Maria",
