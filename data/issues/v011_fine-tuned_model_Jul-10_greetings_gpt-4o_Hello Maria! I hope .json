FWD offers a range of life insurance plans that can be tailored to meet your specific needs.\n\nWe provide term life insurance, which is a straightforward coverage for a set period of time. It\u2019s a cost-effective way to secure financial support for your loved ones in case something unexpected happens. We also have whole life policies that offer coverage until the end of life, with the added benefit of accumulating cash value over time. This can be a great option to secure your family\u2019s financial stability and even contribute to building a savings component.\n\nAdditionally, I can talk you through our riders which can be attached to main policies, offering extra coverage for critical illness or accidental death, which might be particularly interesting to someone looking to start a family.\n\nWe can always customize the policies based on your preferences, future goals, and current financial situation. Shall we delve a bit deeper into which plan might best suit your needs?"

Yeah, I'm good thanks.' seems to be answering a question that wasn't asked in the visible conversation. Additionally, her question 'So, you're Alex, right?' suggests she's confirming the identity of the person she's talking to, which is more typical of a sales agent or customer service representative initiating a conversation, rather than a customer. This behavior doesn't align with what we'd expect from a typical customer interaction."
