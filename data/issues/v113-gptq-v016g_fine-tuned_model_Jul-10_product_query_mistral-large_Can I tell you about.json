I'm not an insurance agent.' sounds more like an AI assistant or a service representative clarifying a misunderstanding, rather than a typical customer response. A customer would be unlikely to need to clarify that they are not an insurance agent, as this would typically be assumed. This suggests that Maria is responding in a way that's out of character for a customer in this conversation."
