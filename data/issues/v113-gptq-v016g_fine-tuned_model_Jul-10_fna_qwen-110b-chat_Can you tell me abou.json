As for my spending habits, I'd say I'm quite frugal, but sometimes I splurge on things I don't really need. I mean, who doesn't love trying out new restaurants or buying the latest gadgets, right?

To help you prepare for buying a house, we'll first need to estimate the price range of homes you're interested in and then work out how much you'd need for a down payment, typically 10-20% of the home's cost. We can also explore different timelines for achieving this goal based on your current savings rate and potential adjustments to your budget. How soon are you hoping to purchase your home?"
