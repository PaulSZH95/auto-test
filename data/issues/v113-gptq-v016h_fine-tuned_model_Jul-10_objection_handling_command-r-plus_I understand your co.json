She refers to herself in the third person, which is unusual, and the phrasing 'Thank you again for your time' is more typical of a sales agent or service provider concluding a conversation with a customer, rather than a customer speaking to a sales agent. This suggests that Maria's dialogue is not consistent with the expected role of a customer in this conversation."
