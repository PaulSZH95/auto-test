      "content": "Great question! The key difference is that the accidental death benefit has a much faster payout compared to regular life insurance. Regular life insurance has a longer process due to more thorough investigations. The accidental death benefit, however, is designed for immediate financial support in such tragic cases."

This allows policyholders to use this amount as they see fit\u2014for medical bills, recovery expenses, or even living costs while unable to work. It\u2019s quite flexible and designed to ease the financial burden during tough times."

    {
      "role": "Alex",
