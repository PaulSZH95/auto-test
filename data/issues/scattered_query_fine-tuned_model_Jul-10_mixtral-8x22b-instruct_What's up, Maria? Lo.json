She refers to 'you guys' crashing into each other and asks about needing financial advice, which suggests she has prior knowledge of a situation not established in this conversation. Additionally, her question about financial advice sounds more like something a sales agent or financial advisor would ask, rather than a typical customer. This response seems to assume context that isn't present in the given conversation, making it feel out of place for a customer role."
