The coverage limits generally depend on the selected plan, but typically, you can expect substantial coverage for a wide range of medical services, including hospital stays, surgeries, and prescription medications.\n\nFor maximum out-of-pocket expenses, your plan will specify an annual limit on what you need to spend for covered healthcare services. Once you reach this limit in a given year, the insurance will cover 100% of the allowable costs for covered services for the remainder of the year. This protects you from high medical costs and helps manage your financial liability.\n\nThe specifics of these limits and the costs you might incur can vary based on the tier of policy you choose, so it's important to review these details closely when selecting your plan to ensure it fits your healthcare needs and budget."
