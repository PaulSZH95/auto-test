I'm 28, working as a marketing specialist for a small startup, and I feel like I need to start thinking about what's next. I've got some savings set aside, but I'm not sure where to go from here.

I've got two younger siblings, aged 8 and 11, who rely on me for support. And, of course, I'd like to think about building a nest egg for myself someday.
