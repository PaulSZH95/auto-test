    "rationale": "Maria's response sounds more like that of a customer service representative or AI assistant rather than a typical customer. The phrase 'I'll definitely reach out if I have any questions or need further clarification on anything' is formal and service-oriented, which is unusual for a customer. Additionally, the closing 'Have a great day and enjoy your time!' is more characteristic of a professional or service provider ending a conversation, rather than a customer."
