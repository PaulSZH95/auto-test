It appears to be a response to a thank you that wasn't shown in the provided conversation. Additionally, Alex's response suggests they were providing assistance, which implies Maria was likely the customer receiving help. A customer typically wouldn't say 'You're welcome!' in this scenario, making Maria's response sound more like that of a customer service agent or AI assistant."
