To help you reach them, let\u2019s consider a few strategies:\n\n1. **Budgeting and Cost Management**: Since a significant portion of your income goes towards expenses, it might be helpful to look for areas where you can cut back, especially in the entertainment and hobbies category. This could free up more money to put towards your savings goals.\n\n2. **Emergency Fund**: Your current emergency fund is substantial, but increasing it as planned will provide an even greater safety net. Continually evaluate and adjust the amount based on changes in your expenses and income.\n\n3. **Investment Options**: Since you have a conservative risk tolerance, you might consider slightly more aggressive but still conservative investment options that could yield better returns than regular savings accounts, such as bonds or conservative mutual funds.\n\n4. **Regular Savings Plan**: Automate your savings to ensure a consistent portion of your income goes directly into your savings or investment accounts. This can be crucial in building your funds for your house and retirement.\n\n5. **Long-Term Saving Instruments**: For your retirement and long-term savings, consider instruments like time deposits or government bonds, which offer safe, slightly higher yields over a longer period. This aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.\n\n6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Given the uncertain nature of your contract-based employment, regularly review your financial plan to adapt to any changes in your income or expenses. This will help ensure you stay on track with your financial goals.\n\nWould you like assistance with setting up any of these strategies or need further details on any specific suggestions?"
