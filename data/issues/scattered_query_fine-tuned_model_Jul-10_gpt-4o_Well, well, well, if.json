She starts by referencing a previous conversation about Sam, then abruptly shifts to talking about her career as an insurance agent. This level of detail about her profession and its rewards is more typical of a sales pitch. Furthermore, at the end of her statement, she asks herself a question ('What do you do for a living, Maria?'), which is highly unusual and suggests a scripted or AI-generated response rather than natural conversation. This behavior is more consistent with a sales agent or an AI assistant than a typical customer in a conversation."

She speaks as if she is an actor discussing her profession, mentioning challenges like adapting to new scripts and unlearning acting habits. This is inconsistent with the context where Maria is supposed to be a customer talking to Alex, who works in insurance. Additionally, Maria refers to herself in the third person at the beginning of her message, which is unusual and suggests a mix-up in the conversation flow."
