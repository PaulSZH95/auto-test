    },
    {
      "role": "Alex",
      "content": "Typically, freelancers might consider the following types of life insurance policies:\n\n1. **Term Life Insurance**: This is often a popular choice because it's more affordable. It covers you for a specified term, like 10, 20, or 30 years. If you pass away during this term, the policy pays out to your beneficiaries. It\u2019s straightforward and can be tailored to end around the time you anticipate your financial obligations will decrease.\n\n2. **Whole Life Insurance**: Unlike term life, whole life insurance covers you for your entire lifespan. It also includes a savings component which can grow tax-deferred. This is more expensive but can be a good investment component if you're looking for long-term stability and a cash value accumulation that you can borrow against if necessary.\n\n3. **Universal Life Insurance**: This offers more flexibility than whole life insurance. You can adjust your premiums and death benefits. This policy will also accrue cash value over time at an interest rate set by the insurer, providing both a death benefit and a savings opportunity.\n\nChoosing the right one depends largely on your financial goals and needs. Here\u2019s a simple approach you can take:\n\n- **Assess needs and goals**: Consider what you wish to cover with your life insurance\u2014whether it's just providing for your parents, covering debts, or other financial responsibilities.\n\n- **Consider your budget**: Decide how much you can reasonably afford to spend on premiums. This will help in determining whether term or permanent insurance is more feasible.\n\n- **Future planning**: Think about what your financial situation will look like in the future. If your income is likely to rise, you might choose a plan that allows for adjustments to coverage.\n\n- **Consultation with professionals**: It\u2019s smart to talk to a financial advisor or an insurance expert who can provide insights specific to your personal situation.\n\nGiven your circumstances and the desire to ensure financial stability for your parents, starting with a term life insurance could be a financially manageable way to get the necessary coverage. Once your finances allow, you could consider switching to or adding a whole life or universal life policy for more comprehensive benefits."
