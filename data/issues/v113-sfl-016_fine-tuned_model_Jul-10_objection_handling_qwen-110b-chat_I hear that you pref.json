I'm just someone who tries to manage my finances well' sounds more like a disclaimer or clarification that an AI assistant or a role-player might give when they realize they've been mistaken for an expert. A typical customer in a conversation about insurance would be unlikely to phrase their lack of expertise in this way, especially unprompted. This response suggests Maria is aware of a previous context or role that isn't evident in this conversation snippet, which is atypical for a genuine customer interaction."
