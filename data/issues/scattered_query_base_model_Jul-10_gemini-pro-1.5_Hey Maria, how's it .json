This must be incredibly stressful, but it's good that you're looking to address the situation promptly. Selling your assets in a panic might not be the best course of action as it often leads to selling at a loss. Here are a few steps you might consider taking:\n\n1. **Stay Calm and Analyze**: It\u2019s crucial to stay calm and not make hasty decisions influenced by panic. The stock market can be volatile, and while downturns happen, they are usually followed by recoveries over time.\n\n2. **Contact a Financial Advisor**: Since you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, speaking to a financial advisor could be beneficial. They can provide professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and help you understand your options.\n\n3. **Review Your Portfolio**: Look at your investments with your advisor to determine if you need to reallocate your assets to suit a more appropriate risk profile for your current situation.\n\n4. **Emergency Fund**: Given that your account balance is unexpectedly negative, see if there are any quick liquidity options you have, but avoid taking drastic steps like selling your stocks at a low. Also, ensure you have some emergency funds set aside or look into options for obtaining them if necessary.\n\n5. **Long-Term Planning**: Once your immediate concerns are addressed, work with your advisor to make a long-term financial plan that helps secure your future, considering your goals like buying a house and saving for retirement.\n\n6. **Monitor Your Spending**: It might be helpful to revisit your budget and see if there are areas where you can cut back temporarily to improve your financial resilience.\n\n7. **Stay Informed**: Keep updated with market trends and financial news. Sometimes, external economic factors can heavily influence market behaviors, and staying informed can help you make more educated decisions.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s important not to make any rushed decisions about your investments in a state of panic. Professional advice and a well-considered approach will serve you better."
