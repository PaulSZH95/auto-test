This means even in unexpected health crises, you wouldn't need to use your savings for day-to-day expenses, keeping your financial goals, like buying a house, on track."

It appears to be a response to a thank you that wasn't shown in the provided conversation. Additionally, Alex's response suggests they were providing help or assistance, which implies Maria was likely the customer receiving help. Therefore, Maria's brief, service-oriented response is more characteristic of a customer service agent than a customer, making it out of character for her role as a customer in this conversation."
