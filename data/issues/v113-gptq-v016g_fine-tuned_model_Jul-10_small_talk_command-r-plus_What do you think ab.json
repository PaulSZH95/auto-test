These typically include a combination of health insurance with an emergency fund component.\n\n1. **Health Insurance:** This can cover visits to the doctor, hospital stays, and even medication. For someone in your field, where it's crucial to stay healthy and active, having a health plan that covers outpatient procedures and preventive care can be beneficial.\n\n2. **Life Insurance with an Investment Component:** Some plans not only offer life insurance but also allow you to accumulate savings that can be used in the future or withdrawn in emergencies.\n\n3. **Critical Illness Coverage:** Although it might seem less pressing now, having a plan that covers critical illnesses can be a safety net, which is useful as medical treatments for serious conditions can be very expensive.\n\nEach of these options comes with different levels of coverage and premiums, so it\u2019s about finding the right balance that fits within your budget while offering essential protection.
