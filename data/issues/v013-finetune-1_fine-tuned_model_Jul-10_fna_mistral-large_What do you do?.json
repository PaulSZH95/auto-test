Here are a few strategies:\n\n1. **Increase Monthly Savings**: If possible, increasing your savings could help you reach your goal faster. For instance, saving $2,000 a month will get you closer to the $100,000 mark in three years.\n\n2. **Explore Additional Income Sources**: Consider side gigs or freelancing to boost your income.\n\n3. **Reduce Expenses**: Re-evaluate your spending to see if there are areas you can cut back on to reallocate more towards your savings.\n\n4. **First-Time Homebuyer Programs**: Look into local or federal programs that offer assistance to first-time homebuyers, which might include lower down payment requirements or help with closing costs.\n\n5. **Investment**: While this comes with risks, investing some of your savings could potentially yield higher returns. Speak with a financial advisor to explore safe investment options that fit your timeline.\n\nWould any of these strategies work for you, or do you have other ideas in mind on how to adjust your saving plan?"
