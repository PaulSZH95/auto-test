The abrupt shift from discussing sports to asking about the economy seems unnatural and more like a scripted conversation or an AI attempting to change topics.

The phrasing 'Any thoughts on today's economy?' feels forced and artificial, more characteristic of an AI assistant trying to broaden the conversation scope rather than a natural human interaction."
