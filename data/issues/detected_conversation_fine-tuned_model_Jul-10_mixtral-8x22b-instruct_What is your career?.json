While it\u2019s great that you're saving independently, our \"Self-for-Life\" insurance adds a layer of security that savings alone might not cover, like unforeseen health issues or other emergencies.

Often, life insurance is about preparing for the \"what-ifs\" that savings might not be enough to cover, such as critical illnesses or unexpected events. Maybe we could schedule a quick call to discuss how this can be a safety net, rather than an unnecessary extra?"
