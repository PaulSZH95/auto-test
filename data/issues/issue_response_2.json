I'm currently working as a marketing manager at FWD Insurance and my monthly income is around 80k pesos. I allocate 4k pesos for my monthly insurance premium. My monthly expenses, including my dependents, are around 40k pesos. I try to save around 15% of my income, which is around 60000 pesos in the bank. My short-term savings target is to buy a house worth 2 million pesos, and my long-term financial goal is to have income protection and retire comfortably. \n\nAs for my health, I have hypertension, which I've been managing well through medication. My family member has diabetes, which requires regular check-ups. I have an emergency fund of 500000 pesos and prefer hospital class 2. \n\nCan you tell me more about your \"self-for-life\" policy and how it fits into my financial plans?"

Additionally, the agent apologizes without any apparent reason, which seems out of context given the customer's detailed inquiry about their financial situation and request for information about the 'self-for-life' policy."
