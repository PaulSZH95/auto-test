She provides detailed information about an insurance add-on, explains its benefits, and asks if it addresses the other person's concerns. This level of product knowledge and sales-oriented language is inconsistent with typical customer behavior and indicates an out-of-character response for Maria if she is supposed to be a customer in this conversation."
