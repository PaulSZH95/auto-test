    "rationale": "Maria's response of 'You're welcome' appears to be out of character for a customer. This response is typically given after someone has thanked you, but in this conversation, Alex is the one expressing gratitude after Maria's statement. A customer would not usually say 'You're welcome' unprompted or before being thanked. This suggests that the conversation order may be reversed or that Maria's response is not appropriate for the context, making it seem out of character for a customer."
