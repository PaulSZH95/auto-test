As for my finances, I make around 75,000 Pesos per month, and I try to save around 15% of that each month.

I'd be happy to help you learn more about the various options available for homeowners.\n\nThere are several types of renewable energy systems that can be installed at home, each with its own unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Here are some of the most common ones:\n\n1. **Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems**: These systems convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells. They're a popular choice for homeowners, as they're relatively affordable and can save money on electricity bills.\n\t* Cost: The cost of solar PV systems has decreased significantly over the years. A typical residential system can range from $15,000 to $30,000, depending on the size and quality of the installation.\n\t* Benefits: Solar PV systems generate clean energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase property value.\n2. **Solar Water Heaters**: These systems use solar energy to heat water for household use. They're ideal for homes with moderate hot water needs.\n\t* Cost: The cost of solar water heaters ranges from $3,000 to $6,000, depending on the type and size of the system.\n\t* Benefits: Solar water heaters reduce energy consumption, lower utility bills, and provide a reliable source of hot water during power outages.\n3. **Wind Turbines**: Wind turbines convert wind energy into electricity. They're suitable for homes located in areas with consistent wind speeds.\n\t* Cost: The cost of wind turbines varies widely, ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 or more, depending on the size and quality of the turbine.\n\t* Benefits: Wind turbines generate clean energy, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and can increase property value.\n4. **Geothermal Heating and Cooling Systems**: These systems harness the natural heat of the earth to provide heating and cooling. They're ideal for homes built near geothermal aquifers or underground rock formations.\n\t* Cost: Geothermal systems can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 or more, depending on the complexity of the installation.\n\t* Benefits: Geothermal systems provide efficient heating and cooling, reducing energy consumption and utility bills.\n5. **Small-Scale Hydroelectric Systems**: These systems harness the energy of moving water to generate electricity. They're suitable for homes located near streams, rivers, or creeks.\n\t* Cost: Small-scale hydroelectric systems can be costly, with prices ranging from $20,000 to $100,000"
