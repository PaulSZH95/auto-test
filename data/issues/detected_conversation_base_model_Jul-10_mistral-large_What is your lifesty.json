When I'm not stuck in front of a computer screen, I enjoy reading books on psychology and self-improvement, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I also love taking long walks around the city, exploring new neighborhoods and trying out different food spots. As for my social life, it's been...interesting lately. I've been having trouble finding someone special, and the dating scene seems to be getting more and more superficial. But hey, I'm not giving up hope just yet!"

      "content": "Honestly, I haven't really given much thought to life insurance. To be honest, I've been putting off thinking about it because it feels like something I'll deal with later.

At FWD, our \"Self-for-Life\" insurance product offers flexible plans that can be tailored to your personal and financial needs, ensuring that you're covered no matter where life takes you.

    {
      "role": "Alex",
      "content": "Certainly, Maria! Our \"Self-for-Life\" product offers various coverage levels starting from moderately priced premiums, ensuring it's accessible for different budgets.

      "role": "Maria",
      "content": "Yeah, that sounds good. I'd like to get a better understanding of how this policy works and what kind of coverage I'd be getting. But before we schedule anything, can you give me a rough idea of what kind of premium I might be looking at? I don't want to waste my time if it's going to break the bank."

      "role": "Maria",

We can certainly customize the policy to include the specific benefits that are most relevant to your lifestyle and circumstances. This way, you can have a comprehensive safety net that truly supports you. Would you like to discuss these options in more detail during our consultation?<|eot_id|>"

You can review and adjust your policy online through our customer portal or via our mobile app. This way, you can make changes, add or modify riders, and keep track of your coverage anytime and anywhere. \n\nWould you like to proceed with scheduling a consultation so we can get all the details sorted out for you?"
