      "content": "Life insurance... yeah, I've thought about it, but I haven't really looked into it too much. To be honest, I'm more concerned about making ends meet each month than planning for the future. My expenses seem to be piling up, and I'm already feeling stressed just trying to make sure my family's needs are met. I don't know if I could afford another expense on top of that."

It might be worth considering that FWD\u2019s \"sef-for-life\" plan can be customized to your budget, potentially offering you peace of mind without overwhelming your finances. Shall we explore an option that fits within your current financial situation?"

    },
    {
      "role": "Alex",
      "content": "Yes, Maria, the \"sef-for-life\" policy would indeed pay out a lump sum to your beneficiaries in the event of your passing, which can be used for various financial needs, including funeral expenses. I will include all these details in the quote. Let's make sure you're completely informed and comfortable with what we offer."
