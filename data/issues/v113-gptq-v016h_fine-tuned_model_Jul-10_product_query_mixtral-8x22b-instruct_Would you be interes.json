      "role": "Alex",
      "content": "Certainly! Set-for-Life insurance is a type of long-term income protection insurance. Here\u2019s how it generally works:\n\n1. **Coverage Selection**: You choose a coverage amount that typically ranges from a portion to a majority of your regular income. This is the amount you would receive monthly should you become unable to work due to illness or injury.\n\n2. **Waiting Period**: There is an initial waiting period after an illness or injury during which you won't receive payments. This period can vary (e.g., 30 days, 90 days) depending on the policy you choose.\n\n3. **Benefit Period**: After the waiting period, if you are still unable to work, the insurance begins to pay out the agreed amount. These payments continue either until you can return to work, reach retirement age, or the end of the term specified in the policy.\n\n4. **Premiums**: You pay regular premiums for the policy, which can be monthly or annually. These premiums depend on several factors, including your age, health, occupation, and the coverage amount.\n\n5. **Protection**: The main benefit of Set-for-Life insurance is the assurance that you will still have a source of income if you lose your ability to earn due to health reasons, which helps cover daily expenses and maintain your standard of living without depleting your savings or emergency funds.\n\nThis type of policy is designed to provide peace of mind and financial stability in case your earning capacity is impacted, complementing your existing financial safety nets."
