Videos of cats squeezing into tiny boxes or playing hide and seek are both adorable and hilarious.\n3. **Cats and Cucumbers** - There\u2019s a humorous trend where cats unexpectedly encounter cucumbers, leading to some exaggerated startled reactions.\n4. **Talking Cats** - Videos where cats 'talk' or make unusual sounds can be particularly entertaining.\n\nYou can find these types of videos on video-sharing platforms like YouTube or on social media sites by searching for these keywords.

This level of personal inquiry and follow-up is more typical of a counselor, therapist, or close friend rather than a customer in a typical customer-agent interaction.
