    "rationale": "Maria's statement 'I am not an insurance agent' is not typical of a customer in a conversation with a sales agent or customer service representative. This declaration seems more like a clarification that might be given by an AI or a system entity defining its role, rather than a natural customer response. In a typical customer-agent interaction, a customer would not need to specify that they are not an insurance agent. This response is therefore out of character for a customer."
