I'm currently working as a marketing manager at FWD Insurance and my monthly income is around 80k pesos. I allocate 4k pesos for my monthly insurance premium. My monthly expenses, including my dependents, are around 40k pesos. I try to save around 15% of my income, which is around 60000 pesos in the bank. My short-term savings target is to buy a house worth 2 million pesos, and my long-term financial goal is to have income protection and retire comfortably. \n\nAs for my health, I have hypertension, which I've been managing well through medication. My family member has diabetes, which requires regular check-ups. I have an emergency fund of 500000 pesos and prefer hospital class 2. \n\nCan you tell me more about your \"self-for-life\" policy and how it fits into my financial plans?"

Additionally, the agent doesn't directly address the customer's specific questions about market comparisons and examples of achieving long-term financial goals, which would be expected in a typical sales conversation."
