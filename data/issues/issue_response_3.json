You can choose monthly, quarterly, or even annual payments depending on what suits your financial situation better. Plus, once you choose a plan, your premiums will remain the same throughout the entire term."

    "rationale": "Maria's response sounds more like a sales agent or insurance representative than a customer. She provides detailed information about insurance premiums, policy types, and payment options, which is knowledge typically possessed by someone working in the insurance industry rather than a customer. This level of expertise and the professional tone used in explaining insurance details is out of character for a typical customer in a conversation about insurance."
