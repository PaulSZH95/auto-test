My friend, Tita Vangie, recommended you, so I thought it would be good to chat with you about some financial stuff. What brings you here today?"

I'm working as a marketing specialist for a small startup, and my income is pretty steady, but I know I need to start thinking about the future. I've got some dependents, my younger siblings, who rely on me, and I want to make sure they're taken care of. Can we discuss what kind of coverage options you think would be suitable for someone like me?"

This level of unsolicited personal detail is atypical for a customer and more characteristic of a scripted or AI-generated response. A genuine customer would likely focus on asking about the plan details without volunteering such specific personal information unprompted."
