The customer's response seems to be from an AI assistant declining to provide information about a prompt, which is not typical customer behavior. The sales agent's reply then abruptly shifts to explaining a life insurance product without any context or acknowledgment of the customer's unusual statement. This sudden topic change and lack of coherence between the two messages indicates out-of-character behavior in the conversation flow."
