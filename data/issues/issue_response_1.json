    "rationale": "Maria's statement 'I am a joke!' does not sound like a typical customer interaction. It's an unusual and self-deprecating statement that doesn't align with normal customer behavior or inquiry. This type of statement is more likely to be an AI or chatbot's attempt at humor or self-reference, rather than a genuine customer comment. Therefore, it appears to be out of character for a customer in a typical customer service interaction."
