I'm currently working as a marketing manager at FWD Insurance and my monthly income is around 80k pesos. I allocate 4k pesos for my monthly insurance premium. My monthly expenses, including my dependents, are around 40k pesos. I try to save around 15% of my income, which is around 60000 pesos in the bank. My short-term savings target is to buy a house worth 2 million pesos, and my long-term financial goal is to have income protection and retire comfortably. \n\nAs for my health, I have hypertension, which I've been managing well through medication. My family member has diabetes, which requires regular check-ups. I have an emergency fund of 500000 pesos and prefer hospital class 2. \n\nCan you tell me more about your \"self-for-life\" policy and how it fits into my financial plans?"

The customer asked about balancing savings and budgeting, without mentioning any specific policy. The agent's initial response seems disconnected from the customer's actual query, suggesting they may have mixed up conversations or misunderstood the context. While the agent does eventually address the customer's questions about savings and budgeting, the initial part of their response is out of character for the given conversation."
