Her statement 'Uh, my birthday is... um... *checks notes*...' suggests she's reading from a script or notes, which is unusual for someone discussing their own birthday. A real customer would typically know their birth date without needing to check notes. Additionally, the phrase '*checks notes*' is more commonly used in role-playing or scripted scenarios, not in natural conversation. This response sounds more like someone playing a role or an AI attempting to simulate a human response, rather than a genuine customer interaction."
