Here's a brief comparison of term life and whole life policies:\n\n### Term Life Insurance:\n- **Coverage Duration**: Provides coverage for a specific term, usually 10, 20, or 30 years.\n- **Premiums**: Generally lower and fixed for the term duration.\n- **Payout**: Pays a death benefit if the insured passes away during the term.\n- **Cash Value**: Does not accumulate cash value; purely for protection.\n- **Best For**: Individuals looking for affordable, temporary coverage to protect dependents or cover specific financial obligations like a mortgage.\n\n### Whole Life Insurance:\n- **Coverage Duration**: Provides lifelong coverage as long as premiums are paid.\n- **Premiums**: Higher than term life but remain fixed throughout the policy.\n- **Payout**: Pays a death benefit whenever the insured passes away.\n- **Cash Value**: Accumulates cash value over time, which can be borrowed against or withdrawn.\n- **Best For**: Individuals seeking permanent coverage with an investment component, and those who want to leave a legacy or cover estate taxes.\n\nEach type has its own advantages depending on your financial goals and needs. Would you like to dive deeper into either of these options?"
