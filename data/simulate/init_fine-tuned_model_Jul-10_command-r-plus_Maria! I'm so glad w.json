    "content": "Absolutely, Maria! The Self-for-Life plan is designed with flexibility in mind, and that includes providing benefits for your loved ones. Here's how they can benefit:\n\n**Spouse or Partner:** They can be included as a joint life insured on your policy. This means they will also be covered and enjoy the same benefits as you under the plan. This option ensures that both of you have financial security and peace of mind.\n\n**Children:** If you have children, they can be added as beneficiaries to your policy. In the event of an unforeseen circumstance, they will receive the benefits from your plan, ensuring their financial future is taken care of.\n\n**Other Dependents:** The plan can also extend to cover other dependents living with you, such as elderly parents or relatives with special needs. By including them as beneficiaries, you can ensure that they will be financially supported if something happens to you.\n\nAdditionally, the Self-for-Life plan offers the option to customize your coverage. You can choose to increase your sum assured (the amount of money your beneficiaries will receive) to ensure that it adequately covers your loved ones' needs. This way, you can make sure that they are well-provided for, even in your absence.\n\nSo, Maria, if you decide to go ahead with the Self-for-Life plan, rest assured that not only will you have financial security, but your loved ones will also be taken care of, which is incredibly important. If you have any specific concerns or further questions about how the plan can benefit your family, please feel free to ask, and I can provide more detailed information."
