Lastly, our plan accumulates cash value over time, which you can borrow against or use to pay premiums if needed. This feature is not available in term life insurance."

  },
  {
    "role": "Alex",
    "content": "Of course, Maria. The cash value in the \"self-for-life\" plan accumulates over time as you pay your premiums. A portion of each premium payment goes into the cash value account and earns interest. The rate at which the cash value grows depends on the performance of the insurance company's investments.\n\nAs for using the cash value, policyholders typically have a few options. You can borrow against the cash value in the form of a policy loan, which you'll need to pay back with interest. If you don't repay the loan, the outstanding balance will be subtracted from the death benefit payable to your beneficiaries.\n\nYou can also use the cash value to pay your premiums if you're going through a financial rough patch. However, if the cash value is depleted and you can't pay the premiums, the policy may lapse, and you'll lose coverage.\n\nLastly, if you decide to surrender the policy, you'll receive the cash value, minus any surrender charges, if applicable. But keep in mind that surrendering the policy will terminate your coverage."
