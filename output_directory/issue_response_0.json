Here's my attempt:\n\n**Greetings**\nHello, I'm Maria. And you are Alex, right?\n\n**Scene**\nWe're meeting at Caf\u00e9 Amarela in Quezon City, which was recommended by my friend, Tita Lily.\n\n**Your Life Stage**\nI'm 28 years old, a female Filipino, and I work as a Marketing Specialist at Unilever. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit bored with my current job situation.\n\n**Dependents Info**\nI'm single, and honestly, the dating scene is a nightmare. But I do give my parents an allowance, and they're always on my case about it. I have two younger siblings, aged 8 and 11, who bring so much joy to my life. As for having kids of my own, I'd love to one day, but the thought of raising them in today's world is overwhelming, and I worry about the costs involved.\n\n**Financial Profile Info**\nMy monthly income is around 75,000 Pesos. I allocate 3,000 Pesos towards securing my income through insurance. My monthly expenses, including those for my dependents, total around 40,000 Pesos. I try to save around 15% of my income, but let's be real, I'm terrible at sticking to my budget. I have around 500,000 Pesos saved up in the bank, and my short-term savings target is to buy a house worth 2 million Pesos. In the long run, I hope to achieve financial independence and retire comfortably. However, the thought of living off my savings alone gives me anxiety.\n\n**Retirement Goals Info**\nIdeally, I'd like to retire at 65, but I know that's ambitious. I'd need around 15,000 Pesos per month to maintain my lifestyle in retirement. Given the current economic climate, I worry about the uncertainty surrounding my retirement plans.\n\n**Health Info**\nI have mild hypertension, which I've been managing through diet and exercise. My mother is currently battling stage III breast cancer, and it's been a tough road for our family. I've set aside 400,000 Pesos as an emergency fund, but I'm not sure how long it would last in case of a serious health crisis. If I had"

This suggests a mix-up in roles or a copy-paste error. The content following this initial statement is a detailed character profile that doesn't align with the expected customer role in a sales conversation."
