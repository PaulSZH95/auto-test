The customer's message contains multiple responses from an AI assistant, discussing the structure of the conversation itself and asking for prompts. The sales agent's response also acknowledges the role-playing nature of the interaction. This meta-discussion about the scenario and prompts is out of character for a genuine customer-agent conversation about insurance."
